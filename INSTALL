Installation is quite straight forward, it is deploying everything into a
directory called <prefix>/beast where prefix is specified on command line to
the ant script as -Bprefix=<somepath>, default prefix is /opt/baltrad.

The beast library depends on the baltrad-db apis so you will need to provide
that path as well, this is done by specifying -Bbaltraddb.path=<path>,
default baltraddb.path is /opt/baltrad/db-devel.

So, to install the beast library you will only have to do "ant install"
unless you want to specify a different prefix and/or baltrad-db path.
